# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:
Pewlett_Hackard hired me to help their HR Analyst Bobby create a database. Retirement packages will be offered to employees who meet specific criteria. This analysis assists the company by using SQL to query data from 6 CSV files to make sure the data is clean and accurate.

## Results:

### Deliverable 1: # of Retiring Employees by Title

 - In the Data folder there are 3 csv created for this deliverable.
	1. *retirement_titles.csv* was created to find which employees were born in right time frame for retirement, but this list has multiples because it includes all titles a person has had within the company.
	2. *unique_titles.csv* aims to fix the issue with the previous table by filtering the list to include only the last title an employee had at the company.
	3. *retiring_titles.csv* counts how many employees from each job title are retiring and thus creates a short list of which positions need to be filled in the near future.
 - B

### Deliverable 2: Employees Eligible for the Mentorship Program
 - In the Data folder 1 csv was created for this deliverable. 
	1. *mentorship_eligibility.csv* find current employees eligible for retirement because of their age. 
 - B

## Summary:

The summary addresses the two questions and contains two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight. 
Provide high-level responses to the following questions, then provide two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami."

How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?

Does it matter how long someone worked for the company before they reached retirement? That's a lot of money that could be saved.
